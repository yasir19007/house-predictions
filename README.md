# house-predictions
This project aims to predict housing prices in King County, Washington using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project consists of various features related to housing properties, such as square feet, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and year built. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on these features.

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the deep learning model, extensive data preprocessing was performed to ensure the data was clean and suitable for modeling. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing numerical features. Additionally, categorical features were one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical representations.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights into the data and identify patterns, EDA was conducted. This involved visualizing the distribution of features, calculating summary statistics, and exploring the relationships between different features. The EDA helped identify important features that are likely to influence housing prices.

# Deep Learning Model
A deep learning model, specifically a neural network, was chosen for this project due to its ability to learn complex relationships between features and predict continuous outcomes. The neural network architecture consisted of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by an output layer with a linear activation function.

# Model Training and Evaluation
The neural network was trained using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The training process involved iteratively updating the model's weights to minimize the MSE loss. The model was evaluated on a holdout test set to assess its performance.

# Results
The trained model achieved an MSE of 0.05 on the test set, which corresponds to an accuracy of approximately 80%. This indicates that the model can make accurate predictions of housing prices based on the input features.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning for predicting housing prices. The model developed in this project can be used to estimate the value of a house based on its features, which can be valuable for various applications such as real estate pricing, property valuation, and investment decision-making.
